# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ryszard

Software Engineer at [Allegro](https://about.allegro.eu/). Master of Science in Computer Science. Graduate of the Jagiellonian University.

Experienced in Java and Kotlin backend tech stacks.

I prefer to learn new things by [Changing Stuff and Seeing What Happens](https://twitter.com/thepracticaldev/status/720257210161311744).

I'm a big fan of the [Extreme Ownership concept](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ljqra3BcqWM) and would recommend you to read [Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin](https://goodreads.com/book/show/23848190-extreme-ownership).

Also, I'm used to watching [The Last Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo) given by Carnegie Mellon Professor Randy Pausch or reading the [book by the same name](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2318271.The_Last_Lecture) every year. It inspires me on how to achieve my own career and personal goals and it reminds me that:

> - "Luck is where preparation meets opportunity.",
> - "You can always change you plan, but only if you have one.",
> - "Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted. And experience is often the most valuable thing you have to offer.",
> - "When you're screwing up and nobody says anything to you anymore, that means they've given up on you.".

During my studies in Computer Science at Jagiellonian University I did bunch of crazy and interesting things like: 

- Project at detecting and classifying stress by analyzing mechanical computer steering patterns:
  - Radio KrakÃ³w: Artificial Intelligence understands your emotions - a new era of gaming ([content in Polish](https://www.radiokrakow.pl/audycje/pracuja-na-nobla/interfejes-emocjonalny-nowatorskie-badania-nad-baedaniem-emocji-uczestnika-gry-przy-pomocy-sztucznej-inteligencji/)),
  - Polskie Radio: Laboratory of the future at the Jagiellonian University ([text in Polish](https://www.polskieradio.pl/9/201/Artykul/1247414,Laboratorium-przyszlosci-na-Uniwersytecie-Jagiellonskim)).
- Master's Thesis on generating supervised machine learning pipelines using genetic programming ([content in English, excerpt in Polish](https://github.com/ryszardmakuch/generating-supervised-ml-pipelines-using-genetic-programming)).
